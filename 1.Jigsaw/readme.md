On day 1,19-APR-2020,
I have decided to build a small jigsaw game, thee will be 5 images and once the user click on start playing button one among the 5 images will be chosen in random and it will be broken in to 9 small images,

once user drags and drops the images in the expected order , then the program will validate and provies result.
